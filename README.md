# Next.js 15 App Router Dynamic Import Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when using dynamic imports within a component. The import works correctly in development mode but fails during production builds.

## Bug Description

The issue revolves around dynamic `import()` statements used to load components or modules conditionally. In development, the code executes as expected, but the production build fails to include or execute the dynamically imported code, resulting in runtime errors.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev` (development mode).  Observe that the application runs as expected.
4. Run `npm run build && npm run start` (production mode).  Observe the error in the browser console.

## Solution

The solution involves a change in the dynamic import strategy; in this instance the problem is solved using a different dynamic import statement.

## Additional Notes

This issue highlights the complexities of dynamic imports within Next.js 15's App Router and the potential discrepancies between development and production environments.  More information and investigation could provide a better understanding of edge cases.
